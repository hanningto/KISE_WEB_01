# JavaScript Functions Basics

This project provides an introduction to JavaScript functions, covering basic concepts, syntax, parameters, function creation, function calls, and a simple application example.

## Topics Covered

1. **Introduction to Functions**  
   Functions in JavaScript allow us to encapsulate reusable code blocks that perform specific tasks. They help in organizing code and reducing repetition.

2. **Parameters**  
   Parameters allow us to pass values (such as integers or strings) to functions. This makes functions versatile and adaptable to different data inputs.

3. **Function Creation**  
   Functions can be created in various ways in JavaScript. The simplest way is using the `function` keyword to define a function block.

4. **Function Calls**  
   Once defined, a function can be "called" or executed with specific parameters to perform its task.

5. **Application**  
   An application example combining these concepts, showing how functions can be used in real-life scenarios to perform meaningful tasks.
